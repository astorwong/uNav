1. Navigation - closest to which node in a multi-pointed room?
For GeoJSON, should we use multipoints or should we use a combination of [points](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#positions)
 instead?

2. Are we deploying via some web server? Running locally? Throwing python scripts online? Chucking python scripts entirely?
[A* for JS](http://www.briangrinstead.com/blog/astar-search-algorithm-in-javascript)

This is the basic template that will be used for each of our weekly sprints. Hopefully, we'll get some good navigation going on here.

Cheers.
